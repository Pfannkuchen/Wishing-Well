This experimental app uses the __Coin Collection of the UB Leipzig__.

You find yourself in front of a __Wishing Well__. Pick one of 5 coins and take a close look: Can you guess what time and circumstances account for its creation? What is it made of and what was it worth? Toss your favourite coins into the shallow waters to find out.

The demo of Wishing Well can be used in any __desktop browser__. Every time you throw a coin, a random hand of new coins will be selected from the data set. To display the coins in 3D, meta data like diameter, material and pictures are used to __procedurally generate a realistic coin__. The data set contains almost 30.000 coins, so every hand of coins will be unique.

Plans for the future:

- onboarding / tutorial
- ability to take a closer look at coins
- ability to revisit already thrown coins
- more accessibility settings
- mobile device app deployment (iOS & Android)
